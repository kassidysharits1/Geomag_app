### Geomag_app
Data gridding exercise.

Please make a grid and map from the MagAnomaly data in the DataBoxTest.csv file.

You may choose the grid interval and interpolation method that you find most appropriate for the data provided. Similarly, you may choose how best to represent that data patterns in map form.

The DataBoxDotMap.jpg file shows a plot of the data locations, colored by MagAnomaly value.


The data file has the following data columns:

X,Y = position coordinates (in meters)

SurveyID = name of the marine data survey

SurveyNumber = integer indentifier of data survey

MagAnomaly = magnetic data survey value (in units of nanotesla)

uncertainty = Survey-level uncertainty value for the MagAnomaly data column (in units of nanotesla)

### Approach and process:
The process of my work is shown both in a jupyter notebook and .py file. 

If running in the terminal: python3 mag_plots.py 

Plots creates from the .py file are stored in the "plots" directory
