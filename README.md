Data gridding exercise.

Please make a grid and map from the MagAnomaly data in the DataBoxTest.csv file.

You may choose the grid interval and interpolation method that you find most appropriate for the data provided. Similarly, you may choose how best to represent that data patterns in map form.

The DataBoxDotMap.jpg file shows a plot of the data locations, colored by MagAnomaly value.


The data file has the following data columns:
X,Y = position coordinates (in meters)
SurveyID = name of the marine data survey
SurveyNumber = integer indentifier of data survey
MagAnomaly = magnetic data survey value (in units of nanotesla)
uncertainty = Survey-level uncertainty value for the MagAnomaly data column (in units of nanotesla)
